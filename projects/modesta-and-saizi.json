HSCO brings students together to create custom storybooks tailored to the personalities of specific children, then prints them and ships them to the orphanages.</p><p>The book features bold illustrations with bright, contrasting color combinations. All the drawings were drawn by hand, then scanned in and colored digitally.</p>",
