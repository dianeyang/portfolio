    "description": "This is a children's book my roommate and I made for Harvard College Stories for Orphans. She wrote the story, and I drew the illustrations. HCSO pairs writers and illustrators to create a story tailored for kids in orphanages. We were assigned Modesta and Saizi, a boy and a girl living in Malawi. The entire process took a few months from conception to completion. Then, the books were printed and shipped to the orphanage.",
