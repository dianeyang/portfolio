	"description": "<p>Worked on a team of 3 to develop this JavaScript-based SAT prep app for Microsoft Surface. I implemented the vocabulary flashcards feature that allows users to study the definitions of 1000 words by pulling them from a remote Parse database, then saving the user's progress locally. In addition, I implemented much of the front-end interactions and styling, including the navigation bar, which features submenu panels that animate by unfolding in an overlay.</p><p>Get Prepped was featured in the <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/may14/05-20webcast.aspx' target='_blank'>Microsoft Surface Pro 3 announcement</a> in May 2014 (skip to 9:56).",
