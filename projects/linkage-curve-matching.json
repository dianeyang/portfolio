    "name": "Four-bar Linkage Curve Matching",
    "description": "<p>For the final project for 6.S079 (Computational Fabrication at MIT), my partner and I built a way to automatically generate and simulate four-bar linkages with a coupler point that traces a path that closely matches a desired path.</p><p>Image 1: The user clicks and drags Bezier splines to specify the desired path (this works much like the Photoshop pen tool).</p> Image 2 + 3: A genetic algorithm tries to optimize the length of the four bars and the position of the coupler point (while respecting certain constraints to ensure that the linkage is physically possible). We measure fitness using 'signature curves', which we get by plotting normalized arc length against curvature for each curve, then aligning and rescaling the curves to match as closely as possible. This metric has the nice property that if two curves have the same general shape, they will be a good match even if their scale, rotation, or position are different.</p><p>Image 4: The program visualizes a simulation of the output linkage and produces and SVG file that can be used for laser cutting.</p>",
