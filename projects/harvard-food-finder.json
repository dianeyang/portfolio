    "name": "Harvard Food Finder",
    "description": "<p>An automated website that uses machine learning to find free food opportunities on campus, then extracts the event details and posts them online. It originated as a CS50 final project, but my partner and I continued working on it afterwards.</p><p>I implemented the Bayesian classifier that I trained to detect emails sent over Harvard mailing lists that mentioned free food, inspired by Bayesian spam filters. In addition, I designed the web app portion of the project.</p>Food Finder was featured in the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Svg0lUmYo&t=37s' target='_blank'>Harvard Gazette</a>. It was later one of the 15 projects accepted into HackHarvard Hack Week 2013 out of a pool of about 50 projects.<p>",
