    "description": "<p>Harvard I/O is an annual event organized by the Harvard Innovation, Technology, and Entrepreneurship Collaboration (HITEC). I was asked to do graphic design for the event, including the flyer shown here. My designs were also used in the event's <a href='http://www.hrvd.io' target='_blank'>website</a>, and the event pamphlet.</p><p>The inspiration was to combine flat design, bold colors, and clean lines to catch the viewer's eye and promote a sense of modernity.",
